🚚 OEM Fastening Solution for Conveyor Sorting Systems

Custom-Engineered Bolts, Brackets & Fixings — Designed for Automation, Built for Downtime-Free Operation

💡 Why Leading Parcel Sorter OEMs Choose Gorgeo

When you're designing high-speed, 24/7 automation lines, fasteners aren’t just “parts” — they're load-bearing, precision-critical connection points.
We specialize in non-standard fasteners, engineered for structural integrity, repeatable assembly, and zero-maintenance operation.

🧠 More Than Fasteners — We Engineer Fit, Fatigue, and Function

Most failures aren’t due to size errors — they're due to:

Misaligned brackets

Incomplete preload transfer

Stress concentration at profile joints

Vibration-induced loosening over time

Our engineering team works with your R&D, integrating fastening strategies at the design stage, preventing problems before they reach the assembly floor.

Each solution below comes from a real failure event inside parcel sorting projects — from hub loosening to assembly jamming.
